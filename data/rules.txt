There are 5 epidemic cards, draw one and an epidemic is spread drawing 3 cards
and spreading 3 cubes of disease through those cities.
A city with 4 cubes has an outbreak spreading that disease to neaby cities,
this does stack up.
If you reach 8 outbreaks you lose.
If you run out of cubes for a disease (24 available) you lose.
You can tell your AI agent to do certain moves and it will try its best.
A research center is always setup in Atlanta when you start, also there
will be 3 3 cube, 3 2 cube and 3 1 cube cities contamined at start
Good luck.
